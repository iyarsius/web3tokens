## IERC20FlashMint.flashLoan property

Performs a flash loan. New tokens are minted and sent to the `receiver`<!-- -->, who is required to implement the `IERC3156FlashBorrower` interface. By the end of the flash loan, the receiver is expected to own value + fee tokens and have them approved back to the token contract itself so they can be burned.
